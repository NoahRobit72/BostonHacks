## Inspiration
After reading about the Digital Dreamers program, began to remis about the good old days of reading childrens books. We missed the adventure, suspense, and creativity that came with reading childrens books.

We set out to bring back that feeling of adventure and creativity with our application. 

We wanted to create a platform where users could take simple pictures with generatic object and turn them into magnificent stories.

We hope you love our application as much as we do!

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us!
