##Extra Implementation
There were some aspects of the project that we were not able to fully complete. Each individual character created was going to have their own voice based off of their personalities and genders. There are several examples 

of waveforms in the GitHub that show various audio clips that were AI generated for our characters. We also intended for the story to be interactive so kids can be a true part of the story. Instead, we hope that they are 

able to use their imaginations with the open-ended endings of the stories we created.


## Inspiration
After reading about the Digital Dreamers program, began to remis about the good old days of reading childrens books. We missed the adventure, suspense, and creativity that came with reading childrens books.

We set out to bring back that feeling of adventure and creativity with our application. 

We wanted to create a platform where users could take simple pictures with generatic object and turn them into magnificent stories.

We hope you love our application as much as we do!

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us!
